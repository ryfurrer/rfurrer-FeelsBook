# rfurrer-FeelsBook
I need to empirically understand my feelings. So I need to record my current feelings. Make a simple, attractive, intuitive, mobile app to record feeings quickly. Let us call this app: FeelsBook.
The feelings that should be supported are:

love, joy, surprise, anger, sadness, fear

derived from here: http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm from

Shaver, P., Schwartz, J., Kirson, D., & O'Connor, C. (2001). Emotional Knowledge: Further Exploration of a Prototype Approach. In G. Parrott (Eds.), Emotions in Social Psychology: Essential Readings (pp. 26-56). Philadelphia, PA: Psychology Press.


Each record of a feeling will include:

Feeling or Emotion (categorical)
Timestamp (presented to the users in iso8601 Date&Time format e.g. 2018-09-01T18:30:00 )
Comment, Optional text (up to 100 characters)
Only the coment  field might be left blank for a subscription.

The app should allow the user to:

Quickly record an emotion with only 1 click on the app and add an optional comment.
See a count of each emotion recorded
Browse and view the history of emotions.
view and edit the details past emotions.
delete a past emotion.
